## Compatibility

- **Note Types**: Works with any note containing markdown checkboxes
- **View Support**: Works in *Reading view* and *Live Preview*. Does not work in *Source mode*
- **Requires Compatible Theme:** Any theme that adds checkbox styles (e.g. [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) or [Things](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things))

## Third-Party Plugin Compatibility

### Tasks Plugin Integration

Optional integration with the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin. When enabled, Tasks can add done dates when you mark checkboxes as *complete* using the Checkbox Style Menu.

#### Enabling Tasks Integration

1. Install and enable the Tasks plugin
2. Open **Settings → Community Plugins → Checkbox Style Menu**
3. Expand the **Advanced** section
4. Toggle on **Enable Tasks plugin integration**

#### Known Limitations

- **Cancelled → Complete**
	Changing from `[-]` (cancelled) → `[x]` (complete) will not trigger a done date. This is because this transition is not part of Tasks’ normal completion workflow. To add a done date, Tasks expects the sequence `[-]` → `[ ]` → `[x]`.

- **Complete → Custom State**
	Changing from `[x]` (completed) → `any custom checkbox style` (such as `[!]`, `[?]`, or `[>]`) will not remove the done date. This is because Tasks expects the sequence `[x]` → `[ ]` to remove it.

All other transitions (such as `[ ]` → `[x]`, `[!]` → `[x]`, or `[x]` → `[ ]`) work seamlessly with Tasks' done date feature.

**Note:** The **Set done date on every completed task** feature must be enabled in Tasks' settings for this integration to work.

## Troubleshooting

### Menu Not Working

- Check that you're long-pressing (not just clicking) a checkbox
- Ensure you have a compatible theme enabled 
- Verify the long-press duration in settings matches your preference

### Mobile Issues

- Make sure you're not scrolling while trying to long-press
- Make sure you're not missing the checkbox (they can be small on mobile)
